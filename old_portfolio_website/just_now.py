Over the three years I have spent at Ekiti State University as an accounting student, I have come to realise that having enough funds to cater for one's needs goes a long way in achieving goals especially when the family’s income is low to afford the large and repetitive demanding dues of a state university like mine.
As a student in my freshman year my aim was to graduate with a first class from the university. However, I currently have an upper second class grade of 4.1 out of 5 in a class with just a student on firstclass(above 4.5). I have put lots of effort to achieve this feat but my financial needs have been a burden to struggle with while aspiring for excellence in my academics. Achieving excellence in my career is one important goal I have and getting a scholarship will go a long way to achieve the goal in several ways as discussed below.
The scholarship award will push me further towards my Accounting degree and my dreams of one day having a successful career as an Accountant. I have always aspired to learn the right way to manage money and to produce successful budgets. I also believe in giving back to my community by helping others in financial crises, so they won’t have the same financial burdens that I had growing up in a single family household.

Receiving this scholarship will boost my drive, knowing that I not only completed a very important task, but also took the responsibility of creating a foundation for getting me closer to my career goals. I believe in the importance of earning a qualification from the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.  
Two years from now I see myself employed at a large financial firm, crunching numbers, evaluating, and solving certain financial matters. I just feel blessed that I am given the opportunity to be awarded a scholarship to help fulfill my dream and I will prove that I do have what it takes to not only be a successful student, but an outstanding accountant.
This scholarship would mean the world to me. I am working my way through the institution by selling clothes; a trade my parents are as well into, here on campus to aid financial needs. A scholarship award would help me focus more on my schoolwork.
