          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>

          <p>
              With close to a year of development experience with a number of projects, I realized that the typical product creation process
          between clients and developers was flaem. All 100 developers rarely communicate to clients through the development stage resulting in a final
          product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this reason, I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly communication and transparent design
            patterns. When I take on a project, not only do I work to craft the application according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates
              to ensure that the project is aligned properly with the client's goals. The end result is the right product delivered on time and on budget.
          </p>
